## Mbed OS build tools

### Mbed CLI 2
TO DO

## Application functionality

**Note**: This example requires a target with RTOS support, i.e. one with `rtos` declared in `supported_application_profiles` in `targets/targets.json` in [mbed-os](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os). For non-RTOS targets (usually with small memory sizes), please use [mbed-os-example-blinky-baremetal](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-blinky-baremetal) instead.

## Building and running

1. Connect a USB cable between the USB port on the board and the host computer.
1. Run the following command to build the example project and program the microcontroller flash memory:

    * Mbed CLI 2

    ```bash
    $ mbed-tools compile -m <TARGET> -t <TOOLCHAIN> --flash
    ```

    * Mbed CLI 1

    ```bash
    $ mbed compile -m <TARGET> -t <TOOLCHAIN> --flash
    ```

Your PC may take a few minutes to compile your code.

The binary is located at:
* **Mbed CLI 2** - `./cmake_build/mbed-os-example-blinky.bin`</br>
* **Mbed CLI 1** - `./BUILD/<TARGET>/<TOOLCHAIN>/mbed-os-example-blinky.bin`

Alternatively, you can manually copy the binary to the board, which you mount on the host computer over USB.
