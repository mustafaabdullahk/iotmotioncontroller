## Application functionality



## Building and running

1. Connect a USB cable between the USB port on the board and the host computer.
1. Run the following command to build the example project and program the microcontroller flash memory:

    * Mbed CLI 2

    ```bash
    $ mbed-tools compile -m <TARGET> -t <TOOLCHAIN> --flash
    ```

    * Mbed CLI 1

    ```bash
    $ mbed compile -m <TARGET> -t <TOOLCHAIN> --flash
    ```

Your PC may take a few minutes to compile your code.

Alternatively, you can manually copy the binary to the board, which you mount on the host computer over USB.
